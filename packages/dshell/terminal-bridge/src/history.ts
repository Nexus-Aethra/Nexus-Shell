/**
 * The command history a session's shell keeps across boots.
 *
 * The bridge's in-memory records are per boot: a restart respawns the shell and
 * the composer's up-arrow list would start empty even though the terminal view
 * replays its own scrollback from disk. This is that missing half — the command
 * lines, their exit status and their time.
 *
 * The durable form is `history-store.ts`: one SQLite database for the whole
 * harness home, keyed by session. This class is the facade the bridge drives —
 * a bounded in-memory window for the keystroke path (unchanged from the JSON
 * days, so the up-arrow gesture costs no query) over a store that keeps every
 * command and can answer prefix matches.
 *
 * A store that cannot be opened degrades instead of failing: the class falls
 * back to the legacy per-session `.history.json` beside the PTY log, which is
 * also where an upgrading installation's history is read from exactly once.
 * History is a convenience; losing it must never cost the session anything.
