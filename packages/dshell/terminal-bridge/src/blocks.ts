/**
 * Block log — the host's block model for one session.
 *
 * The bridge is the only party that knows, at the moment bytes arrive, which
 * block they belong to: it sees every append, and it sees the session's turn
 * boundaries. Deciding there is what makes ordering exact — a browser
 * reconstructing blocks from a replay has to guess, and a replay carries one
 * timestamp for the whole retained window.
 *
 * A block is a stretch of the session, not a command: everything the terminal
 * printed while no turn was running is one shell block, and each turn is one
 * agent block. The list is append-only with a monotonic sequence, so a client
 * can page it and can apply live deltas without re-reading history.
