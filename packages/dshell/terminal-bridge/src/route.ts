/**
 * The bridge's HTTP face: one read of a session's shell history.
 *
 * The shell's own history is already recorded here — the command splitter pairs
 * every submitted line with its output and exit status, and the record list is
 * what the agent's terminal tool reads back. The composer needs the same list
 * for its up-arrow gesture, and it cannot get it from anywhere else: the
 * terminal's scrollback is a rendered stream, while these records are the lines
 * the user actually ran.
 *
 * The request carries the composer's draft, and the answer is the *newest*
 * commands starting with it (oldest first, so the list's bottom row stays the
 * newest match). Searching here rather than in the browser is what makes the
 * query cost independent of how much history exists: the bridge answers from
 * the durable store's index, so the rows the composer may match are not limited
 * to the ones it was sent — and the response stays bounded by `limit`.
 *
 * Read-only on purpose, and never spawning: a session without a live shell
 * answers with no commands rather than getting one created to answer a
 * question about it.
