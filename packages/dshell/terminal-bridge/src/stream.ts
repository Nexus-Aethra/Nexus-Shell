/**
 * The bridge's transport-neutral face: the same frames the `/dshell/pty`
 * upgrade carries, over routes on the shared API channel.
 *
 * Why both exist. The ws path is the browser's fast path — one socket, no
 * per-frame request, authenticated by the same cookie the rest of the app uses.
 * It needs `webServer`, though, and the desktop shell composes `connection`
 * without it (its transport is a framed byte pipe behind the `dsh-app://`
 * scheme, so there is no port to upgrade). A `connection.fetch` route is
 * reachable from every composition that has `connection`, which is why the
 * desktop shell can host a terminal at all.
 *
 * Two routes, not one, because a route is selected by exact path: the
 * downstream half is a long-lived GET whose body is newline-delimited JSON, and
 * the upstream half is a POST per control frame. They share the client's own
 * `clientId` — an HTTP stream has no socket to key on, so identity travels
 * explicitly. Everything below the carrier (spawning, buffering, block order,
 * reconnects) is the bridge's existing code, untouched.
