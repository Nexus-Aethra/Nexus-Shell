/**
 * Terminal rendering for a shell region.
 *
 * A region is everything the terminal printed while no agent task was running:
 * prompts, command echoes and their output, in stream order. It is rendered by
 * a real xterm instance, so the terminal keeps its own design — PS1 line,
 * colours, carriage-return redraws — with no synthetic per-command chrome.
 *
 * Column count is the load-bearing decision here. The bytes were produced at
 * the PTY's width, which is not necessarily this column's width, and a
 * redraw line that does not fit gets wrapped: `\r` then returns to column 0 of
 * the *continuation* row, so every repaint consumes a row and a progress bar
 * stacks down the screen instead of overwriting itself. A region that contains
 * bare carriage returns therefore renders at least as wide as its widest line.
 *
 * The FONT, unlike the grid, is one size for every region: the PTY's width
 * changes over a session's life (it starts at the backend's default and is
 * resized to the column once the view measures one), so historical stretches
 * legitimately hold lines printed at a different width than today's. Scaling
 * each region's font to fit its own widest line made those stretches render at
 * different sizes in the same view — which reads as a broken terminal, not as
 * history. A region whose grid is wider than the column scrolls horizontally
 * instead; `ShellRegion` already gives the host `overflow-x: auto` for it.
