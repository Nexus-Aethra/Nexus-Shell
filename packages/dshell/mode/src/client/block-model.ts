/**
 * The block view's timeline model.
 *
 * A block is a *stretch of the session*, not a single command: the view
 * alternates shell regions with agent tasks. Everything the terminal printed
 * while no task was running belongs to one shell region — prompt, commands and
 * output in stream order, exactly the terminal's own design, with no synthetic
 * per-command chrome. A task starts a block; the shell output that follows it
 * opens the next region.
 *
 * Regions are cut from the PTY arrival segments, so the split happens at the
 * task boundaries the reader actually saw, not at the commands inside a
 * region.
