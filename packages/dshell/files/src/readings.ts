/**
 * What a completion read out of its world, kept for a moment so a keystroke
 * does not pay for it twice.
 *
 * The completion path asks its world for two kinds of thing: a directory's
 * children, and what the session's own shell would complete. Both are answers
 * about the world rather than facts this process owns, and both cost a round
 * trip that a DEVICE pays with a process of its own — `ssh` behind the
 * harness's local subprocess runner, measured at roughly 0.4 s per call, against
 * a 23 ms network round trip. A Tab that asked for a directory every time was
 * three of those calls: over a second on a device, six milliseconds locally.
 *
 * So a reading is remembered briefly, and the two things that make remembering
 * it honest live here rather than at the call sites:
 *
 *  - **A short freshness window, and a longer usability window.** A listing is
 *    the one answer a reader compares against what is on their screen, so a
 *    reading is FRESH for seconds ({@link DEFAULT_READING_TTL_MS}); between that
 *    and {@link DEFAULT_READING_STALE_MS} it is still served, but the refresh it
 *    needs is started behind the answer rather than in front of the reader. That
 *    is what keeps a Tab instant after a long pause — waiting for a device to
 *    re-list a directory the reader may not have changed is the wait this feature
 *    exists to remove — while a second Tab a moment later sees the new listing.
 *    Past the stale window the answer is not served at all: by then it is a claim
 *    about a world nobody has looked at for a minute.
 *  - **One reader per key.** A warm and the Tab it was warming for are seconds
 *    apart at most, and two in-flight reads of one key would be two device calls
 *    for one answer. {@link ReadingCache.read} therefore hands the second caller
 *    the first caller's promise — including the background one.
 *
 * The key is the caller's: this class never interprets one. What makes a key
 * correct is that it carries everything the answer depends on — for a directory
 * reading that includes the WORLD (two sessions on this machine share their
 * answers; a session on a device is another machine with other files), which is
 * exactly the mistake the oracle's cache made once.
