/**
 * What the `transfer` tab kind IS, as this package implements it.
 *
 * A page type with a kind of its own — NOT a takeover, and deliberately without
 * a guide entry. Both of those are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - the navigator's kind (`files`) belongs to dsh's shipped file tree, and this
 *    type is a second view rather than a re-implementation of that one, so it
 *    adds a kind instead of shadowing one;
 *  - the right pane seeds its default page from the SOLE guide entry's kind, so
 *    a second entry would move every session's default page onto the guide
 *    itself. The way in is the navigator's header button instead, which is also
 *    where the feature is discoverable — next to the tree it transfers from.
