/**
 * The completion oracle: what the session's own shell answers for a line.
 *
 * The file system can answer "which names start with this word" and nothing
 * else, so `docker r<Tab>` had no source between a PATH lookup (wrong kind of
 * name) and a directory listing (wrong kind of name again). What DOES know is
 * the shell itself: bash-completion registers a completion function per command
 * — `docker`'s knows its subcommands, `git`'s knows its options, `sudo`'s knows
 * how to shift the position so the inner command gets asked — and the session's
 * world is exactly the place those are installed. So we ask it, in a process of
 * its own, and treat its answer as one more source the route can dispatch to.
 *
 * Three boundaries this module holds to:
 *
 *  - **The line is DATA.** It travels as an argument (`bash -c <script> name
 *    <line> <cursor>`) and is never spliced into the script text. The script
 *    itself is written without a single quote character for the same reason,
 *    which is an invariant `tests/shell-completion.spec.ts` asserts rather than
 *    a comment someone has to trust.
 *  - **Nothing here executes the reader's line.** The probe only feeds it to a
 *    completion function, which reads words; it is completion, not evaluation.
 *    That is also why the loader and the function run in a fresh process with
 *    no access to the session's terminal, whose single active send must stay the
 *    user's (`dshell-terminal-bridge` mirrors the visible terminal read-only).
 *  - **Failure is silent.** A world without bash-completion, a device that will
 *    not answer, a function that dies: all of them return "no answer", and the
 *    caller falls back to what it already knew. A completion must never cost the
 *    reader the answer they would otherwise have had.
 *
 * The trust note that belongs in the code and not only in docs: the functions
 * being run are CODE ON THAT MACHINE — which is what the reader's own Tab already
 * runs when they press it in a terminal. This asks the same question in a
 * separate process instead of typing into their shell, and it never executes the
 * line: a completion function reads the words, and the probe is what feeds them
 * to it.
