# dshell Development Roadmap

Each phase ends with a runnable artifact that exercises a real slice of
dsh's existing extension points. Do not move to the next phase until the
current one ships its acceptance check.

The phases are ordered so that each one adds one decision from
[`dshell-design.md`](./dshell-design.md). Skipping ahead risks rebuilding
because decision points become load-bearing later.

## Phase 0 — Repo scaffold

Goal: the dshell workspace exists as a sibling to `dsh/` and pnpm picks
it up.

Deliverables:

- `/home/wpp/nexus/Nexus-Shell/` initialized as a pnpm workspace.
- A workspace `package.json` that references `dsh/` as a local workspace
  root or pulls dsh packages via npm `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` ranges.
- One placeholder `packages/dshell-meta/` package with an empty plugin
  to prove the workspace builds.

Acceptance check:

```
cd /home/wpp/nexus/Nexus-Shell
pnpm install
pnpm -F @deepseek-ai/dsh-* run build
# (dsh's bundled CLI runs against this workspace)
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web
# Web UI loads at 127.0.0.1:3080
```

## Phase 1 — Bundle + empty target

Goal: register a `terminal` target that renders nothing yet, but proves
the target registration path works.

Covers decision: 4.1 (session isolation) at the registration level.

Plugins touched:

- `dshell-bundle` (new) — patches the `web` profile to include the
  browser half packages.
- `dshell-conversation` (new, host face only) — registers a
  `ConversationViewDefinition` for target `terminal` whose
  `ViewBuilder.empty` returns a `Snapshot` with an empty `rows` array.

Acceptance check:

```
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web --profile web
# Sidebar lists sessions. Main panel shows the new "terminal" target
# (selected via settings) with an empty viewport. session/event still
# drives the chat target because nothing changes that one.
```

## Phase 2 — Main shell lifecycle

Goal: bridge owns a `name: 'main'` PTY for the active agent; the PTY
streams bytes into a host-side buffer; nothing is rendered yet.

Covers decision: 4.2 (main shell ownership).

Plugins touched:

- `dshell-terminal-bridge` (new, host face) — owns
  `mainPtyByAgent: Map<Agent, TerminalSessionId>`; calls
  `ctx.terminals.spawn` lazily; reads bytes through `readOutput`.
- `dshell-conversation` (host face) — exposes a typed channel from the
  bridge's PTY buffer to the browser-side `ViewBuilder`.

Acceptance check:

- A test agent (`ctx.agents.create({ sessionId })`) gets a main shell
  on first access; `ctx.terminals.list(agent)` contains
  `{ name: 'main' }`.
- A second `terminal_open({ name: 'main' })` from the agent creates a
  separate session; `mainPtyByAgent` is untouched.
- The bridge's per-session buffer accumulates bytes after `startSend`.

## Phase 3 — WebSocket transport

Goal: a browser running the dsh Web UI can connect a ws to
`/dshell/pty` and see main shell bytes stream into the page.

Covers decisions: 4.2 (routing), 4.4 (delivery, host half).

Plugins touched:

- `dshell-terminal-bridge` (host face) — adds `registerUpgrade` on
  `ctx.webServer`.
- `dshell-terminal-bridge` (browser face, new) — opens ws from the
  active session binding; relays bytes to a console log first, before
  any rendering.

Acceptance check:

- With dsh web running, opening the browser console shows PTY bytes
  arriving as the agent (or a test agent) writes to `main`.
- The ws respects `{ kind: 'bind', sessionId }` authorization: a bind
  with a wrong id is rejected and closed.

## Phase 4 — xterm.js canvas + interleaved view

Goal: PTY bytes render in xterm.js in the terminal target; session
events render in the same canvas with the merging rule from 4.4.

Covers decisions: 4.1 (ViewBuilder per session), 4.4 (interleaved
rendering).

Plugins touched:

- `dshell-conversation` (browser face) — materializes `Snapshot.rows`
  into one xterm.js buffer; serializes session nodes to ANSI.
- `dshell-conversation` (host face) — drives the ViewBuilder from
  both the PTY byte source and the dsh engine's `replace` / `apply`
  calls.

Acceptance check:

- Open a session, set default target to `terminal` in settings.
- An agent turn (`/agent hello`) and a shell command (`/shell echo
  hi`) appear interleaved in one xterm scrollback, ordered by `time`.
- Switching to a different session shows that session's terminal
  surface independently; switching back shows the original buffer
  preserved.

## Phase 5 — Composer mode toggle + `/agent` / `/shell`

Goal: user controls where the next message goes.

Covers decisions: 4.5 (mode state).

Plugins touched:

- `dshell-mode` (new, browser face) — owns the per-session mode store;
  patches the composer `inputActions` to dispatch by mode; parses
  `/agent` and `/shell` prefixes before dispatch.
- `dshell-mode` (new, host face) — exposes the main PTY session id to
  the browser side through the same channel used by 4.4.

Acceptance check:

- In `shell` mode, Enter sends text to `startSend(mainId, text)`.
- In `agent` mode, Enter sends text to `agent.inject`.
- `/agent plan a feature` from shell mode switches to agent mode and
  injects "plan a feature" as a user message.
- `/shell ls -la` from agent mode switches to shell mode and runs
  `ls -la` in `main`.
- Mode survives a session switch; mode resets to `shell` on `/new`.

## Phase 6 — Real commands (`/clear`, `/new`, `/compact`)

Goal: the three dsh commands that dshell exposes are real
`ctx.commands` registrations.

Covers decision: 4.5 (commands).

Plugins touched:

- `dshell-commands` (new, host face) — registers `/clear`,
  `/new`, `/compact` on `ctx.commands`.

Acceptance check:

- `/clear` clears the xterm buffer and the main PTY scrollback in one
  operation.
- `/new` opens a new session through dsh's standard creation path;
  the new session starts in `shell` mode with no PTY until first
  access.
- `/compact` triggers dsh's compaction service and reports its result.

## Phase 7 — Terminal context injection

Goal: agent turns include the recent `main` PTY output as a leading
context block.

Covers decision: 4.6 (injection).

Plugins touched:

- `dshell-mode` (host face) — when the composer submits in `agent`
  mode, inject the truncated recent-output block before the user
  message.
- `dshell-mode` (browser face) — none; the cap and the prompt-anchor
  detection are host-side.

Acceptance check:

- Run `ls /tmp` in shell mode, switch to agent mode, ask "what was the
  last command output?".
- The model's reply references the captured output verbatim.
- The injection respects the 100-line / 4 KiB cap; a runaway command's
  output is truncated at a UTF-8 boundary.

## Phase 8 — `dshell_get_main_terminal` tool

Goal: the agent has a reliable way to learn the `main` PTY session id.

Covers decision: 4.6 (agent access to `main`).

Plugins touched:

- `dshell-commands` (host face) — adds a model-facing tool registered
  on `ctx.tools`.

Acceptance check:

- After agent start, `dshell_get_main_terminal()` returns the
  `TerminalSessionId` of the bridge's `main` PTY.
- Agent can call `terminal_send` against that id to run a command in
  the user's shell; the bytes stream back into the user's xterm.

## Phase 9 — Hardening

Goal: failure modes from `dshell-design.md` § 6 are observed and
handled.

Plugins touched:

- `dshell-terminal-bridge` (host face) — handles `session_exit`,
  signal-driven close, browser disconnect, and session disposal.
- `dshell-mode` (browser face) — UI feedback when the `main` PTY
  restarts.

Acceptance check:

- `exit` in `main` shell: ws receives `{ kind: 'closed' }`; next user
  input opens a new `main` PTY automatically.
- Browser reload: bridge keeps `main` alive; on reconnection, ws
  re-subscribes to byte stream.
- Closing a session in the sidebar: bridge closes ws and calls
  `ctx.terminals.kill(agent, mainId)` cleanly.

## Phase 10 — Packaging

Goal: `dshell-*` packages install with `pnpm add` and dsh loads them
through `dsh.bundle`.

Deliverables:

- Each `dshell-*` package's `dsh.bundle` row in `package.json`.
- A combined `dshell-suite` bundle package that lists every
  `dshell-*` package as a bundle row.
- A README at the repo root with installation instructions:
  ```
  pnpm add -D @deepseek-ai/dsh-shell-suite
  dsh web --profile web
  ```

Acceptance check:

- `pnpm run constraints && pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run lint`
  passes.
- `pnpm run doc-sync` generates catalog entries without warnings.
- A clean dsh install with only `@deepseek-ai/dsh-shell-suite` added
  loads dshell with no manual config.
